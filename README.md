# CSE231 PrepTests

CSE231 PrepTests aids students in preparing for CSE231 exams by splitting inputted or included old exam .txt files into individual questions. This feature allows for targeted practice and includes a timer for each question to simulate exam conditions. Old tests can be sourced from "https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/Online/Exams/" or the included CSE231TEST folder.
